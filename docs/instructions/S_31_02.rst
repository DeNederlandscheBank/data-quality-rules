==================================

Instructions
------------


General comments:

This section relates to annual submission of information for individual entities.

This template is relevant for each insurance or reinsurance undertaking transferring risk(s) to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), to ensure sufficient disclosure has been made where SPVs are used as alternative risk transfer methods to traditional reinsurance treaties.

The template applies to the use of:

a)

SPVs defined under Article 13(26) and authorised under Article 211(1) of Directive 2009/138/EC;

b)

SPVs meeting conditions of Article 211(3) of Directive 2009/138/EC;

c)

SPVs regulated by third country supervisors where these meet equivalent measures to the conditions set out in Article 211(2) of Directive 2009/138/EC;

d)

Other SPVs, not meeting the definitions above, where risks are transferred under arrangements with the economic substance of a reinsurance contract.

The template covers risk mitigation techniques (recognised or not) carried out by the (re)insurance undertaking whereby a SPV assumes risks from the reporting undertaking through a reinsurance contract; or assume insurance risks from the reporting undertaking transferred through a similar arrangement that is ‘reinsurance like’.
