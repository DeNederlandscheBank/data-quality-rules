=============================================================================

Instructions
------------


General comments:

This section relates to opening and annual submission of information for individual entities, ring fenced–funds, matching adjustment portfolios and remaining part.

Template SR.25.01 has to be filled in for each ring–fenced fund (RFF), each matching adjustment portfolio (MAP) and for the remaining part. However, where a RFF/MAP includes a MAP/RFF embedded, the fund should be treated as different funds. This template shall be reported for all sub–funds of a material RFF/MAP as identified in the second table of template S.01.03.

Where the entity has MAP or RFF (except those under the scope of Article 304 of Directive 2009/138/EC) when reporting at the level of the whole undertaking, the notional Solvency Capital Requirement (‘nSCR’) at risk module level and the loss–absorbing capacity (LAC) of technical provisions and deferred taxes to be reported shall be calculated as follows:

—

Where the undertaking applies the full adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level the nSCR is calculated as if no loss of diversification exists and the LAC shall be calculated as the sum of the LAC across all RFF/MAP and remaining part;

—

Where the undertaking applies the Simplification at risk sub–module level to aggregate the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level the nSCR is calculated considering a direct summation at sub–module level method and the LAC shall be calculated as the sum of the LAC across all RFF/MAP and remaining part,

—

Where the undertaking applies the simplification at risk module level to aggregate the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level the nSCR is calculated considering a direct summation at module level method and the LAC shall be calculated as the sum of the LAC across all RFF/MAP and remaining part.

The adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level shall be allocated (C0050) to the relevant risk modules (i.e. market risk, counterparty default risk, life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk and non–life underwriting risk). The amount to be allocated to each relevant risk module shall be calculated as follows:
