S.13.01 - Projection of future gross cash flows (Best Estimate –life)
=====================================================================

Instructions
------------


General comments:

This part of Annex II relates to annual submission of information for individual entities.

This template shall include information only in relation to the best estimates. The cash flows to be reported are gross of reinsurance and undiscounted.

Cash–flow projections such as central scenarios can be used as no perfect reconciliation with Best Estimate calculation is required. If difficult to project some future cash–flows like collective Future Discretionary Benefits the undertaking shall report the cash flow it effectively uses for calculating the Best Estimate.

All cash flows expressed in different currencies shall be considered and converted in the reporting currency using the exchange rate at the reporting date

In case the undertaking uses simplifications for the calculation of technical provisions, for which an estimate of the expected future cash–flows arising from the contracts are not calculated, the information shall be reported only in those cases where more than 10 % of total technical provisions have a settlement period longer than 24 months.
