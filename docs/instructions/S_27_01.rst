=============================================================================

Instructions

General comments:

This section relates to annual submission of information for individual entities, ring fenced–funds, matching adjustment portfolios and remaining part.

Template SR.27.01 has to be filled in for each ring–fenced fund (RFF), each matching adjustment portfolio (MAP) and for the remaining part. However, where a RFF/MAP includes a MAP/RFF embedded, the fund should be treated as different funds. This template shall be reported for all sub–funds of a material RFF/MAP as identified in the second table of S.01.03.

This template is designed to allow an understanding of how the catastrophe risk module of the SCR has been calculated and what are the main drivers.

For every type of catastrophe risk the risk mitigating effect of the undertaking's specific reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles must be determined. This calculation is prospective and must be based on the reinsurance program of the next reporting year as described in the reinsurance templates for Facultative covers (S.30.01 and S.30.02) and Outgoing reinsurance program in the next reporting year (S.30.03 and S.30.04).

Undertakings need to estimate their recoveries from risk mitigation in line with the Directive 2009/138/EC, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 and any relevant technical standard. Undertakings shall complete the catastrophe reporting template only to the granularity required to perform this calculation.

Under the non–life and health underwriting risk modules, catastrophe risk is defined as the risk of loss, or of adverse change in the value of insurance liabilities, resulting from significant uncertainty of pricing and provisioning assumptions related to extreme or exceptional events as set out in Article 105(2)(b) and (4)(c) of the Directive 2009/138/EC.

The reported capital requirements reflects the capital requirements before and after risk mitigation which is the risk mitigating effect of the undertaking's specific reinsurance contracts and special purpose vehicles. The reported capital requirement after risk mitigation is before the loss absorbing capacity of technical provisions. The default value of the risk mitigation shall be reported as a positive value in order to be deducted.

In case the diversification effect reduces the capital requirement the default value of the diversification shall be reported as a negative value.
