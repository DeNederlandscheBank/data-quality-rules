Instructions

General comment:

This section relates to annual submission of information for individual entities.

This template is to be filled in accordance to the Balance sheet (S.02.01). Valuation principles are laid down in Directive 2009/138/EC, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, Solvency II Technical Standards and Guidelines.

This template is not required to be submitted if one single currency represents more than 90 % of assets and also of liabilities.

If submitted, information on the reporting currency shall always be reported regardless of the amount of assets and liabilities. Information reported by currency shall at least represent 90 % of the total assets and of the total liabilities. The remaining 10 % shall be aggregated. If a specific currency has to be reported for either assets or liabilities to comply with the 90 % rule then that currency shall be reported for both assets and liabilities.
