S.20.01 - Development of the distribution of the claims incurred
================================================================

Instructions

General comments:

This section provides an overview about the run–off/movement of non–life claims portfolios, in terms of both claims paid (split by different type of claims) and RBNS claims (as defined in S.19.01).

This template must be filled for each Line of Business (12 line of business, as defined in Annex I to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, in total) with regards to gross direct business (i.e. undertakings are exempted to report the accepted — proportional and non–proportional — business); in case of RBNS denominated in different currencies, it is required to report only the total in the reporting currency.

With regard to the number of claims to be reported, undertakings will use their specific definition or, if available, specification existing at national level (for instance requirement laid down by the National Supervisory Authority). However, each claim shall be reported once. If any claim is closed and reopened during the year, it shall not be reported in the column ‘Reopen Claims during the year’ but it shall be reported in relevant column regarding ‘Open Claims at the beginning of the year’ or ‘Claims reported during the year’.

Undertakings are required to report data on accident year or underwriting year basis, in accordance with any requirements of the National Supervisory Authority. If the National Supervisory Authority has not stipulated which to use then the undertaking may use accident or underwriting year according to how they manage each line of business, as defined in Annex I to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, provided that they use the same year consistently, year on year.

As per the number of years to be reported, the same reporting requirement introduced in S.19.01 applies.
