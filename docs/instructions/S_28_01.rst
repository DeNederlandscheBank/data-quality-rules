General comments:

This section relates to opening, quarterly and annual submission of information for individual entities.

In particular, S.28.01 is to be submitted by insurance and reinsurance undertakings other than insurance undertakings engaged in both life and non–life insurance activity. These undertakings shall submit S.28.02 instead.

This template shall be completed on the basis of Solvency II valuation, i.e. written premiums are defined as the premiums due to be received by the undertaking in the period (as defined in Article 1(11) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35).

All references to technical provisions address technical provisions after application of Long Term Guarantee measures and transitionals.

The calculation of MCR combines a linear formula with a floor of 25 % and a cap of 45 % of the SCR. The MCR is subject to an absolute floor depending on the nature of the undertaking (as defined in Article 129 (1) (d) of the Directive 2009/138/EC).
