Instructions

General comments:

This section relates to annual submission of information for individual entities, ring fenced–funds, matching adjustment portfolios and remaining part.

Template SR.26.03.01 has to be filled in for each ring–fenced fund (RFF), each matching adjustment portfolio (MAP) and for the remaining part. However, where a RFF/MAP includes a MAP/RFF embedded, the fund should be treated as different funds. This template shall be reported for all sub–funds of a material RFF/MAP as identified in the second table of S.01.03.

All values shall be reported net of reinsurance and other risk mitigating techniques.

Amounts before and after shock shall be filled in with the amount of assets and liabilities sensitive to that shock. For the liabilities the assessment shall be done at the most granular level available between contract and homogeneous risk group. This means that if a contract/HRG is sensitive to a shock the amount of liabilities associated to that contract/HRG shall be reported as amount sensitive to that shock.
