=================================================================

General comments:

This section relates to annual submission of information for individual entities.

The purpose of this template is to collect information according to Article 265 of Directive 2009/138/EC on all (significant, very significant and transactions required to be reported in all circumstances) IGTs related to equity, debt, reciprocal financing and asset transfers related transactions within a group according to Article 213 (2)(d) of Directive 2009/138/EC. These include, but are not limited to:

—

equity and other capital items including participations in related entities and transfer shares of related entities of the group;

—

debt including bonds, loans, collateralised debt, and other transactions of similar nature e.g. with periodic pre–determined interest or coupon or premium payments for a pre–determined period of time.

—

other asset transfer such as transfer of properties and transfer of shares of other companies unrelated (i.e. outside) to the group.

The insurance undertaking is expected to complete this template for all significant, very significant and transactions required to be reported in all circumstances for IGTs between the individual undertaking and the mixed–activity insurance holding company and its related undertakings.

This template shall include IGTs that were:

—

in–force at the start of the reporting period.

—

incepted during the reporting period and outstanding at the reporting date.

—

incepted and expired/matured during the reporting period.

Where similar transactions with a related entity may be excluded from IGT reporting when considered individually against the thresholds for significant and very significant, these transactions must nevertheless be individually reported where collectively they are at or above the corresponding threshold values for significant or very significant IGTs.

Each transaction shall be reported separately.

Any additions/top–ups to significant IGTs shall be reported as a separate IGT, even if the top–up in its own right falls below the significant threshold limit. For example, if an undertaking increases the initial loan amount to another related undertaking the addition to the loan should be recorded as a separate item with its issue date as the date of the top–up.

Where the transaction value is different for two transacting parties (e.g. a EUR 10 m transaction between A and B where A records EUR 10 m but B only receive EUR 9,5 m because of transactions costs, of say EUR 0,5 m has been expensed) the template shall record the maximum amount as the transaction amount, in this case EUR 10 m.

Where there is a chain of related IGTs (say A invests in B and B invests in C), each link of the chain needs to be reported as a separate IGT.
