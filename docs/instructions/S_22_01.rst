General comments:

This section relates to annual submission of information for individual entities.

This template is relevant when at least one long term guarantee measure or transitional is used by the undertaking.

This template shall reflect the impact on the financial positions when no transitional is used and each LTG measures or transitional is set to zero. For that purpose, a step–by–step approach should be followed taking out each transitional and LTG measure one by one and without recalculating the impact of the remaining measures after each step.

The impacts need to be reported positive if they increase the amount of the item being reported and negative if they decrease the amount of the item (e.g. if amount of SCR increases or if amount of Own Funds increases then positive values shall be reported).
