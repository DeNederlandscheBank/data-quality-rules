===================================

Instructions
------------


General comments:

This section relates to annual submission of information for individual entities.

This template contains an item–by–item list of off–balance sheet assets held as collateral for covering balance sheet assets held directly by the undertaking (i.e. not on a look–through basis).

It consists of detailed information from the perspective of the assets held as collateral and not from the perspective of the collateral arrangement.

If there is a pool of collaterals or a collateral arrangement comprising multiple assets, as many rows as the assets in the pool or arrangement shall be reported.

This template comprises two tables: Information on positions held and Information on assets.

On the table Information on positions held, each asset held as collateral shall be reported separately in as many rows as needed in order to properly fill in all variables requested in that table. If for the same asset two values can be attributed to one variable, then this asset needs to be reported in more than one line.

On the table Information on assets, each asset held as collateral shall be reported separately, with one row for each asset, filling in all variables requested in that table.

All items except items ‘Type of asset for which the collateral is held’ (C0140), ‘Name of the counterparty pledging the collateral’ (C0060) and ‘Name of the group of the counterparty pledging the collateral’ (C0070) relate to information on the assets held as collateral. Item C0140 relates to the asset on the balance sheet for which the collateral is held while items C0060 and C0070 relate to the counterparty pledging the collateral.

The asset categories referred to in this template are the ones defined in Annex IV — Assets Categories of this Regulation and references to CIC codes refer to Annex VI — CIC table of this Regulation.
