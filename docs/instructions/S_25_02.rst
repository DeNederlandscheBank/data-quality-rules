===============================================================================================================

Instructions
------------


General comments:

This section relates to opening and annual submission of information for individual entities, ring fenced–funds, matching adjustment portfolios and remaining part.

The components to be reported shall be agreed between national supervisory authorities and insurance and reinsurance undertakings.

Template SR.25.02 shall be reported by ring–fenced fund, matching adjustment portfolio and the remaining part for every undertaking under a partial internal model. This includes undertakings where a partial internal model is applied to a full ring–fenced fund and/or matching adjustment portfolio while the other ring–fenced funds and/or matching adjustment portfolios are under the standard formula. This template shall be reported for all sub–funds of a material RFF/MAP as identified in the second table of S.01.03.

For those undertakings under a partial internal model to which the adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of RFF/MAP is applicable, where the entity has MAP or RFF (except those under the scope of Article 304 of Directive 2009/138/EC) when reporting at the level of the whole undertaking, the nSCR at risk module level and the loss–absorbing capacity (LAC) of technical provisions and deferred taxes to be reported shall be calculated as follows:

—

Where the undertaking applies the full adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level: the nSCR is calculated as if no RFF and the LAC shall be calculated as the sum of the LAC across all RFF/MAP and remaining part;

—

Where the undertaking applies the Simplification at risk sub–module level to aggregate the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level the the nSCR and LAC are calculated considering a direct summation at sub–module level method,

—

Where the undertaking applies the Simplification at risk module level to aggregate the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level the nSCR and LAC are calculated considering a direct summation at module level method.

The adjustment due to the aggregation of the nSCR of the RFF/MAP at entity level shall be allocated (C0060) to the relevant risk modules (i.e. market risk, counterparty default risk, life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk and non–life underwriting risk) when calculated according to the standard formula. The amount to be allocated to each relevant risk module shall be calculated as follows:

—

, where

—

adjustment

= Adjustment calculated according to one of the three methods referred above

—

BSCR′

= Basic solvency capital requirement calculated according the information reported in this template

—

nSCR

int

= nSCR for intangible assets risk according to the information reported in this template

—

Multiplication of this ‘q factor’ by the nSCR of each relevant risk module (i.e. market risk, counterparty default risk, life underwriting risk, health underwriting risk and non–life underwriting risk)
