Instructions

General comments:

This section relates to quarterly and annual submission of information for individual entities, ring fenced–funds, matching adjustment portfolios and remaining part.

Undertakings may apply appropriate approximations in the calculation of the technical provisions as referred to in Article 21 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35. In addition, Article 59 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 may be applied to calculate the risk margin during the financial year.

Line of business for life obligations: The lines of business, referred to in Article 80 of the Directive 2009/138/EC, as defined in Annex I to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35. The segmentation shall reflect the nature of the risks underlying the contract (substance), rather than the legal form of the contract (form). By default, where an insurance or reinsurance contract covers risks across the lines of business undertakings shall, where possible, unbundled the obligations into the appropriate lines of business (Article 55 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35).

Lines of business ‘Index–linked and unit–linked insurance’, ‘Other life insurance’ and ‘Health insurance’ are split between ‘Contracts without options and guarantees’ and ‘Contracts with options or guarantees’. For this split the following shall be considered:

—

‘Contracts without options and guarantees’ shall include the amounts related to contracts without any financial guarantees or contractual options, meaning that the technical provision calculation does not reflect the amount of any financial guarantees or contractual options. Contracts with non–material contractual options or financial guarantees that are not reflected in the technical provisions calculation shall also be reported in this column;

—

‘Contracts with options or guarantees’ shall include contracts that have either financial guarantees, contractual options, or both as far as the technical provision calculation reflect the existence of those financial guarantees or contractual options.

The information reported shall be gross of reinsurance as information on Recoverables from reinsurance/SPV and Finite reinsurance is requested in specific rows.

The information to be reported between R0010 and R0100 shall be after the volatility adjustment, the matching adjustment and the transitional adjustment to the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure if applied but shall not include the transitional deduction to technical provisions. The amount of transitional deduction to technical provisions is requested separately between rows R0110 and R0130.
